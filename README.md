## Background and Motivation

The population and the total expense on outbound traveling of Chinese people have ranked the first in the world for many years in a row. In addition, more and more tourists in Y/Z Generation use online travel applications to book hotels, search for travel guides or share their traveling experience.

Mafengwo is the biggest travel information website in Mainland China.
Considering the data fabrication cases of Wafengwo, we processed our data carefully and manually deleted those invalid data.

## Executive Summary

The main purpose of this report is to figure out the persona of travelers in the Y/Z  generation. By analyzing the users' behavior on the travel experience sharing platform Mafengwo and conducting other qualitative and quantitative researches, this report can be used as a reference for all interested institutions or individuals.
